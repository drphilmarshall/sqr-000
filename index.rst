Technical notes (hereafter, *technotes*) are a new documentation medium for `LSST Data Management <http://dm.lsst.org>`_ staff to publish stand-alone documents that are native to the web.
Technotes are written in reStructuredText, version controlled on GitHub, built with the same stack as DM's software documentation, and made universally citeable `digital object identifiers (DOIs) <http://www.doi.org>`_ through Zenodo_.

This document describes the Technote platform and will be updated as the platform evolves.

DM team members can create a new technote today by following the instructions at https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lsst-technote-bootstrap
